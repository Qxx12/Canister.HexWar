# HexWar

A turn-based hexagonal grid strategy game. Command units across a procedurally generated map, battle five AI opponents simultaneously, and win by capturing all enemy capital tiles.

## Gameplay

- The map is a connected hexagonal grid with varied terrain (grassland, plains, desert, tundra)
- Each player starts on a **capital tile** with a small garrison
- Each turn, all owned tiles generate +1 unit (except tiles captured that same turn)
- Issue **movement orders** to send units from one tile to an adjacent tile
- **Combat**: attacker and defender lose equal units; attacker conquers if their units outnumber the defender's
- **Win** by eliminating all other players (capturing their capitals)

### Orders

- Click an owned tile to select it, then click an adjacent tile to set a movement order
- Choose how many units to send using the stepper (+/−/Max)
- Enable **Repeat each turn** to make the order a standing order that auto-replays every turn
- With repeat enabled, choose **∞** to always send all available units from that tile
- Standing orders appear as hollow arrows on the board

### Game State Flow

```
playerTurn → [human issues orders] → aiTurn → [AI 1..5 resolve] → generateUnits → playerTurn
```

State lives in a React reducer (`useGameState`). The engine is pure functions — all state mutations return new state objects. Animations are decoupled: `App.tsx` maintains a `displayBoard` that lags one step behind `state.board`, advancing as each animation completes.

### Board Generation

1. Grow a random blob (~166 tiles) from the center using a randomized BFS
2. Punch ~22% of tiles as holes using layered positional noise + rng jitter (while maintaining full connectivity)
3. Assign terrain by latitude (r-axis) with slight sine-wave noise
4. Place player start tiles by maximising minimum pairwise distance across 200 random candidates

### Terrain Textures (3D)

Each terrain type has a procedurally generated canvas texture drawn with a seeded RNG (deterministic, no external assets):

| Terrain | Visual |
|---------|--------|
| Grassland | Sparse grass tufts, tiny white flowers |
| Plains | Dry grass strokes, small red/yellow wildflowers |
| Desert | Wavy dune ripples, pebble ellipses |
| Tundra | Snow blobs, olive moss patches, ice-crystal sparkles |

Textures are created once per terrain type and cached for reuse.

### 3D Scene Lighting

The 3D view uses a three-layer lighting model:

- **Ambient light** — low-intensity base fill so surfaces are never fully black
- **Directional sun light** — positioned at the specular mirror of the camera's default viewpoint, so oasis pools catch a specular highlight when the sun is on. Toggled via the ☀ button.
- **Shadow map** — 2048×2048 PCFSoft shadow map; trees, palms, rocks, and deer cast shadows onto tile surfaces. Toggled via the ◐ button.

Tree and palm materials use a small emissive fill (≈20% of their base colour) so the camera-facing sides don't go dark under side lighting.

### Oasis (Desert tiles)

Rare desert tiles (~6% chance) spawn an oasis: an organic water pool with border rocks and 1–2 leaning palm trees. The pool uses a `meshStandardMaterial` with `roughness=0` so it acts as a mirror surface, catching a specular highlight from the directional sun.

### Combat Model

```
casualties     = min(unitsSent, defendingUnits)
remainingAttackers = unitsSent - casualties
conquered      = remainingAttackers > 0 AND remainingDefenders == 0
```

Orders use the **initial board snapshot** at turn start — units that arrive at a tile mid-turn cannot be chained into another order that same turn.

### AI Strategy

The AI uses a four-layer hierarchical architecture (`@hexwar/strategy`):

```
GeopoliticalSnapshot → StrategicPlan → TileConstraints → OrderMap
      (assessor)         (strategies)     (operational)   (tactical)
```

**Strategic layer — High Command**
Reads the board once and produces a `FrontDirective` per neighboring player. Each directive carries a `stance` and a unit budget fraction:

| Stance | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `INVADE` | Full offensive — commit everything |
| `EXPAND` | Push forward when advantageous |
| `HOLD` | Defend; route surplus to other fronts |
| `DETER` | Mass units here to discourage invasion |
| `IGNORE` | Issue no orders toward this neighbor |

**Strategy catalog** (applied in priority order, higher wins):

| Group | Strategies |
|-------|-----------|
| Opportunism | Collapse Exploitation (priority 10), Wounded Enemy (6), Vulture Strike (5), Distraction Exploit (5) |
| Alliance | Common Enemy (4), Don't Finish the Decoy (3) |
| Threat | Deterrence Wall (4), Flanking Deterrent (3) |
| Consolidation | Turtle Mode (7 — defensive override) |

A **two-front cap** in the registry limits simultaneous offensive fronts to prevent unit overcommitment.

**Operational layer**
Translates directives into per-tile `TileConstraint` objects. DETER tiles accumulate units in place; interior tiles are BFS-routed toward active fronts through friendly territory.

**Tactical layer**
Greedy scorer that operates only within the allowed targets and unit budgets. Imports `scoreTarget` / `unitsToSend` from `@hexwar/greedy` (neutral: 35, winnable enemy: 50 + advantage × 3, capital bonus: +45), so the scoring logic is shared and not duplicated. A capital garrison of 1 unit is enforced on enemy-targeted orders; neutral-targeted orders are exempt since neutral tiles cannot counter-attack.

See [`packages/strategy/README.md`](packages/strategy/README.md) for the full design and extension guide.

**Training curriculum** (`ppo_train.py`):

| Phase | Description | Exit condition |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| A — Bootstrap | Learner vs 5 × GreedyAgent opponents | Win rate ≥ 25% or 50 iterations |
| B — Self-play | Population pool; periodic snapshot every 20 iters | 500 iterations |

**Neural model** (`HexWarGNN`): GATv2Conv message passing over the hex graph, 4 layers × 4 heads × 128-dim hidden; edge action head outputs move logit + Beta distribution for unit fraction; separate value head for PPO critic. Node features include K=5 frame-stacked history (34-dim per node).
